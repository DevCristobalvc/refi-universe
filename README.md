# 🌍 ReFi Universe Protocol (ReFiUP)

> *"Like Pokémon Go — but instead of catching Pokémon, you collect trash. Save the world. Have fun."*

A regenerative finance protocol for humanity. Built with OG vibes and Cypher energy.

---

## 🎯 Overview

ReFi Universe Protocol is a revolutionary DeFi application that coordinates human action to clean the planet through economic incentives, while protecting privacy with Zero Knowledge Proofs and validating real-world impact with AI agents.

**The Problem:** Carbon footprint from human activity is destroying the planet. Current systems can't coordinate cleanup at scale while protecting privacy.

**Our Solution:** Human coordination through incentives. Take photo of cleanup → AI validates impact → Earn rewards. All anonymous with Zero Knowledge Proofs.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔒 100% Anonymous**: Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZK-STARKs) protect your identity
- **🤖 AI-Powered Validation**: Standards x402 & ERC-8002 validate real impact against satellite data
- **⚡ Gasless Transactions**: Permissionless system with verifiable impact
- **🌱 Circular Economy**: Real impact generates real value through Impact Certificates
- **🎮 Gamified Experience**: Clean your neighborhood, earn tokens, level up

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom utilities
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **Blockchain**: web3-based (ZK-STARKs, ERC-8002)
- **AI Standards**: x402 (AI Agent Work), ERC-8002 (Hybrid AI Logic)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## 🌟 Inspiration

Born from the climate collapse witnessed at DevConnect Buenos Aires on November 15, 2025. While extreme weather hit outside, we realized web3's true potential isn't just speculation—it's coordination of humanity to solve real-world problems.

**This is web3's original vision: Regeneration, not speculation.**
